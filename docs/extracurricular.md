Apart from being academic researcher, I enjoy coding, learning new programming languages, learning about quantum physics, and watching documentaries on world history. I have a keen interest in photography and exploring different tourist places around the world that are historic or/ and close to nature. I am a vegetarian and enjoy trying different cuisines from around the world.

I believe in a healthy lifestyle and enjoy outdoor activities such as jogging and kayaking. Below are the details of recent races I ran.
