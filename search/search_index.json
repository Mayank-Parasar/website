He received an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2017 and a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering department from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur in 2013. He works in computer architecture with the research focus on proposing breakthrough solutions in the field of interconnection networks, memory system and system software/application layer co-design. His dissertation, titled Novel and Efficient Techniques for Guaranteeing Routing and Protocol Level Deadlock Freedom in Interconnection Networks , formulates techniques that guarantee deadlock freedom with a significant reduction in both area and power budget. He held the position of AMD Student Ambassador at Georgia Tech in the year 2018-19. He received the Otto Jenny Krauss Fellow award in the year 2015-16.
